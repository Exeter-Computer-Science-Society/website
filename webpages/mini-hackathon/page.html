        <h3 class="accent">Overview</h3>
        <p>We ran an amazing mini hackathon event covering an area of disciplines of computer science. Predomenantly, python, lists, sorting, code analysis, regex and sql injection. We are proud to have been able to offer this amazing opportunity for our members as well as providing free pens and pizzas. The winning duo finished just a few seconds shy of the runners up and happily claimed their prize, special stash and unique stickers! </p>
        <p>In addition to this we raised Â£100 on our movember which we as a committee are very proud to say is going towards a great cause. </p>
