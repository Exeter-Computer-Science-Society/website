                    <p>I've always loved researching adventurous, fun projects whether computer science related or not. Being on committee I can run engaging off-course projects that tickle interest, exploration and creativity not only for myself but for others as well. Additionally to this, I can bring back the running of a large Hackathon which I have only ever heard of through word of mouth.</p>

                    <p>Being on committee puts me in a position of responsibility where I can actively change the situation of the society for my peers. By representing my peers it allows me to make changes and host events that are in our members best interest. There are many ways I can see growth for the society and by taking an active committee role I can play a part in making sure these changes come into fruition. Sometimes if you want something done you have to do it yourself!</p>

                    <p>I am a 2nd year computer science student with an interest in cyber security and digital forensics. I chose to be part of the committee to represent women in STEM while developing my skills and knowledge in graphic design along with social media management. I am passionate about feminism, especially within industry. My interests are also in Irish Dance, which I coach at university.</p>
